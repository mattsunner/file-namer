# About

This is a simple file re-naming script that allows the user to mass rename files in a directory using a generic naming convention. This script is perfect for mass editing images, or any other files that benefit from standardized, sequential naming.

## Questions

If you have any questions about the script, please reach out and contact me at sunner.matt@gmail.com
